## Main Branch

- The main branch is the starter code for the tutorial.
- Visit the `start` branch to get started.

The following is a quote from the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#inspecting-the-starter-code):

>By inspecting the code, you’ll notice that we have three React components:
>
>1. Square
>2. Board
>3. Game
>
>The `<Square />` component renders a single `<button>` and the `<Board />` component renders 9 `<Square />` components. The `<Game />` component renders a `<Board />` component with placeholder values which we’ll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.
